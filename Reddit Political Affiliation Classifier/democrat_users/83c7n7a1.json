Don't be so naive to not realize they made plenty of mistakes and went back on their own words at times.\n\nHere is more history for you to sadly deny.\n\n>Virtually all the leading political figures of the new country, starting with Washington, believed that political parties would polarize citizens and paralyze government. Hamilton and Jefferson agreed with this notion, but by 1793 the two groups that they represented had broken off into separate factions. Hamilton's group became the Federalists, while Jefferson's faction adopted the name \"Democratic Republicans.\"\n\nDoes this sound like a familiar division?\n\n>On economic matters, the Jeffersonians differed strongly with the Federalists. The Democratic-Republicans believed in protecting the interests of the working classes\u2014merchants, farmers, and laborers. They believed that an agrarian economy would best serve these citizens. They saw the establishment of a national BANK OF THE UNITED STATES (which Hamilton strongly favored) as a means of usurping power that belonged to individual states, and they also believed that it would be tied too closely to the rich. The Federalists saw industry and manufacturing as the best means of domestic growth and economic self-sufficiency. They favored the existence of protective tariffs on imports (which had Congress had adopted in 1789) both as a means of protecting domestic production and as a source of revenue.\n\nYou should read up and get a more realistic view of the Founding Fathers and their oppositions to each others ideas as well as the history of political parties, because the history does not follow your idealistic quote.\n\nIt's a nice quote, but the reality of their actions tell a different story where political parties and political division cannot be avoided. Divisions were already significant by just 1793 and. The Constitution was ratified in 1789.

That's pretty much where all the crime and justice happens and The federal government really doesn't do much when it comes to enforcing the law other than when it is a multi-state type of intercommerce issue where the states wouldn't have jurisdiction.\n\nYou can also see this when you look at federal law enforcement, which are ultimately a rather tiny force. I know the FBI may sound impressive, but they're only about 35,000 people total. That's less than the police force of New York City. The state of California employs 120,000 police! \n\nWe have that many police at the state level because they're the ones doing the VAST execution of the law and feds mostly just watch and occasionally take notes.\n\nIt's not like on TV where the state cops can't get the job done and the feds swoop in with their unlimited resources. they don't really have unlimited resources and all federal law enforcement combined really doesn't represent a particularly large amount of people, especially compared to the actual amounts of people that run the states police and judiciary systems which is really just a fraction of the overall executive and judicial employees. \n\nThis is also why focusing on local and state law is usually the most effective avenue  when it comes to actually having an impact on your life", "time": 1606999003.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Ha, He's not going to terminate Bill Barr.

These are just instances where people want to punish poor use of taxpayer money or correct bloated funding.\n\nThis is just like calling any other government organization bloated.\n\nYou have to stop being afraid to criticize the police they are only a couple million total employees. They are not some huge influential group of voters or workers or wealth. \n\nThere's a hell of a lot more people that work in food service and there are police and plenty of other industries have far higher amounts of employees so if you're going to kiss anybody's ass you should probably kiss the industry's ass with the most employees or kiss the industry's ass that has the most skill.\n\nPolice are not highly skilled, not a profit-driven industry and not really a ton of people. So we should only cater to them as is practical and necessary which does not include like having six police when you only need two or allowing them all kinds of special privileges and immunity from prosecution. Like 90% of people think police is the super dangerous job and it's not even in the top 10 most dangerous industries. That's how far a reality is off from perception. The amount of police that die per year is crazy low. The police union and the media I believe actually have the police convinced their job is far more dangerous than it actually is and that has the effect of making the police act more scared and trigger happy. \n\nWe have the problem out here in my little rural town, they just keep hiring police for no reason. It's like if you give somebody a budget they're going to justify that budget by trying to grow that budget and then you just wind up in the same corrupt position as as any other government organization or corporation gone wild that tries to grow well beyond its purpose or britches.\n\nHumans are just like that, if you allow them to consume too much and you don't push back against poor spending or greed, they will in general take advantage of those situations and the police departments are no different. It's just a bunch of people doing a job, if they don't have enough oversight they're all going to wind up with their hands in each other's pockets even if they don't know how they got there.", "time": 1606961378.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "More proof Dems big problem is messaging", "time": 1606952794.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Because Bill Barr is not elected to office, duh.", "time": 1606940461.0}], "republican_score": 0, "democrat_score": 5}
