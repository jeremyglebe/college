It seems there's a tendency for Conservatives to not have the same type of access to things like diversity of thought, culture and a tolerance of those things in the way that many Democrats do. So it becomes an 'us vs. them' thing. Their view of Democrats, that has been nurtured by right wing media, is so twisted and untrue that it ends up hurting the very people Democrats would like to see brought to the table. It really is the party that looks out for the 'regular Americans.' Seems like a lot of Conservatives would prefer to kiss the hand that beats them just so they can have an enemy. Makes no sense.

What wasn't acknowledged here is 40 years of mind fuckery that speaks to white grievance, poor me,' and sheltered existences. It's why they co-opted 'patriotism,' the flag and 'real' American values. Easy to do and very effective. You don't beat that with facts. You beat it by changing their enemy. They NEED enemies. And the reality is that Democrats, by and large, just don't view the world through the same lens. You'd need Democrats to throw out their life view and feed lies, anger and hate. \n\nWhat I'd like to see is a Democrat with some STONES who, in no uncertain terms, lays out the propaganda those folks have been fed, WHY they've been fed it and get them to focus on their real enemy. An enemy that is shared by urban residents struggling to afford an apartment as well as the red hat wearing Bubba swinging a hammer. THE VERY RICH. Those who are pulling the strings and directly impacting the lives of most all of us.
