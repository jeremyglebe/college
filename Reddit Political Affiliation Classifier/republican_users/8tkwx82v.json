Instead I\u2019m seeing a lot of political opinion, being presented as fact,  when it isn\u2019t.***\n\nThe media wants you to believe the election is over.\n\nBy law, it isn\u2019t.\n\nUnless a candidate concedes, **the election remains in play until December 14th** **when states cast their electoral college votes**.\n\nSo,  unless President Trump concedes between now and then, Joe Biden hasn\u2019t  won anything, no matter what the media tells you. Indeed, the media has  no say in this, anymore than they can decide what color the sky is;  they\u2019re simply trying to get you angry so you\u2019ll continue to watch their  awful shows so they can sell your eyeballs to advertisers.\n\nWith  that in mind, \u00a0we need to take a step back and assess how this election  is likely to play out based on the LAW, not public opinion or media  propaganda.\n\nBased on the law, it is highly possible **and in fact probable that Donald Trump will end up winning the 2020 Presidential election.**\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the election is now in the courts. **And the courts have a clear precedent for how contested elections play out.**\n\nWhen  the courts get involved in an election, it\u00a0becomes an issue of  evidence. Specifically, what a given court decides is compelling versus  non-compelling evidence, and how the court chooses to address the issue  of voter fraud if indeed there is compelling evidence.\n\nFor instance, if President Trump\u2019s legal team goes to court and says, \u201c*we want to have a vote audit in Michigan because there was voter fraud\u201d* the first thing the court will ask them is, *\u201cwhat evidence do you have to support this claim?\"*\n\nIf the President Trump\u2019s legal team\u2019s answer is *\u201cwe saw some numbers that looked suspicious,\u201d* the court controls its urge to laugh, throws out the case, and that\u2019s that.\n\nHowever, if the President\u2019s legal team responds, *\u201cwe have sworn affidavits from 50 witnesses, video evidence, as well as three whistleblowers\u201d* then it\u2019s a completely different story.\n\nOnce evidence of fraud is introduced to the courts via a lawsuit, **the court, NOT the voters and certainly NOT the media, is in charge of the election.**\n\nThe  courts can demand a vote audit of every single vote counted in an  election. If, during the vote audit, actual fraud is discovered, the  court can rule that those votes are no longer valid, the formal vote  counts can change, and\u00a0**it is possible that a given state ends up declaring a different winner.**\n\nEven if fraud is\u00a0*not*\u00a0discovered  by the audits, but there is a particular problem with vote cards (the  wrong type of ink was used, the hole punch didn\u2019t go all the way through  the ballot as was the case in Florida in 2000, etc.), the courts can  deem those problematic votes as illegitimate.\n\nThis  again can mean the formal vote counts can change, and it is possible  that a given state ends up declaring a different winner.\n\nThis process is now underway in **Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona.**\n\nAny  one of those states could see Biden end up losing (remember, he only  won these states by 0.5% for most of them). That means that if Biden  loses even 10,000 votes due to fraud or some technicality (the ballots  arrived after the deadline), Trump could be declared the winner.\n\n**Again,  I am NOT saying I want this to happen. I am simply outlining how this  process works. If a court says \u201cjump\u201d you jump, no matter who you are.**\n\nSpeaking of which\u2026\n\nTwo weeks ago, Supreme Court Justice Alito (as in the Supreme Court of the U.S., not of just one state) **ORDERED the State of Pennsylvania to segregate and count separately any ballots that arrived after 8PM on election night.**\n\nThis  is a legal order from the Supreme Court of the United States. If you  disobey it, you can go to prison. And because it\u2019s a federal violation,  the lawsuit isn\u2019t going to be \u201cJoe Schmo vs. John Doe,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cthe United  States of America vs. Joe Schmo.\u201d\n\nMy sources tell me that for Alito to order this without any comment from other justices suggests **the Supreme Court as a whole is supportive of his action.**\n\nSo, this is the Supreme Court of the United States effectively stating, *\u201cwe are now getting involved in this mess.\u201d* That is a big deal.\n\nIf  you are looking for a reason as to why the media rushed into announcing  Joe Biden as the President Elect Saturday (the day after Alito\u2019s  order), this is probably it.\n\nThe Democrats and their media allies (the media companies that lean left) realize that **once the courts get involved, the odds of Biden actually winning drop dramatically**.  So, they are attempting to mount as much pressure as possible for  President Trump to concede so that the election is finished before ever  entering a courtroom.\n\nRemember, the only way this election ends right now is if President Trump concedes.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t, but instead chooses to fight in court, then the process follows the path I outlined a little while ago, **where the courts decide which votes count and which ones don\u2019t.**\n\nFor  an election in which multiple states were \u201cwon\u201d by less than 0.5%, the  odds GREATLY improve for President Trump once these issues are  introduced in court. He only needs to have 10,000 or so ballots thrown  out in order to flip multiple states.\n\nAnd bear in mind, that if a given court accepts or rejects a given lawsuit, the situation doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nIf  either party or candidate is dissatisfied with a lower court\u2019s ruling,  they can appeal the ruling, which can result in the lawsuit moving up to  a higher court, eventually reaching the Supreme Court, which serves as  the ultimate arbiter of election law in the U.S.\n\nThis  was the case with the 2000 Presidential election, when the Supreme  Court ruled that vote cards from Florida that didn\u2019t have clean hole  punches were NOT valid, which gave the state to George W. Bush and\u00a0**resulted in Al Gore conceding the election on December 13th.**\n\n**And  the Supreme Court\u2019s justices are currently 6-3 conservative to liberal.  Even if Roberts were to side with the liberals, the conservatives still  hold the 5-4 majority.**\n\nPut  simply, the ultimate arbiter in court rulings on elections favors  Trump. Provided he DOESN\u2019T concede, the odds greatly favor him winning a  second term.\n\nThat\u2019s what the law and the courts say. And they\u2019re the ones that matter in this situation.", "time": 1605728382.0}, {"subreddit": "republicans", "text": "His incompetence is leading to a R governor next. \n\nHis greed will ensure it.", "time": 1605723032.0}], "republican_score": 33, "democrat_score": 0}
