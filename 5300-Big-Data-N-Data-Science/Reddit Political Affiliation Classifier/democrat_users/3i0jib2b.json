That's just over the 270 threshold for victory. \n\nThese steps in the election are often ignored formalities. But the hidden mechanics of electing a U.S. president have drawn new scrutiny this year as President Trump continues to deny Mr. Biden's victory and pursues increasingly specious legal strategies aimed at overturning the results before they are finalized.\n\nAlthough it's been apparent for weeks that Mr. Biden won the presidential election, his accrual of more than 270 electors is a key step toward the White House, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University. \n\n\"It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,\" Foley said. \"Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.\"\n\nThe electors named Friday will meet December 14, along with counterparts in each state, to formally vote for the next president. Most states have laws binding their electors to the winner of the popular vote in their state, measures that were upheld by a Supreme Court decision this year. There have been no suggestions that any of Mr. Biden's pledged electors would contemplate not voting for him. \n\nResults of the Electoral College vote are due to be received, and typically approved, by Congress on January 6. Although lawmakers can object to accepting the electors' votes, it would be almost impossible for Mr. Biden to be blocked at that point. \n\nThe Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate would both vote separately to resolve any disputes. One already has arisen from Pennsylvania, where 75 Republican lawmakers signed a statement on Friday urging Congress to block the state's electoral votes from being cast for Mr. Biden. But the state's Republican U.S. senator, Pat Toomey, said soon after that he would not be objecting to Pennsylvania's slate of electors, underscoring the difficulty in trying to change the election results through Congress.\n\n\"As a practical matter, we know that Joe Biden is going to be inaugurated on January 20,\" Foley said.\n\nThat was clear in the days after the election, when the count of mail ballots gradually showed that Mr. Biden had won victories in enough states to win the Electoral College. It became even more apparent in late November, when every swing state won by Mr. Biden certified him as the winner of its elections and appointed his electors to the Electoral College. Mr. Trump has fruitlessly tried to stop those states from certifying Mr. Biden as the winner and appointing electors for the former vice president. \n\nHe made no such effort in deeply Democratic California, the most populous state in the nation. Three more states won by Mr. Biden \u2014 Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey \u2014 have not yet certified their results. When they do, Mr. Biden will have 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232. \n\nMr. Trump and his allies have brought at least 50 legal cases trying to overturn the results in the swing states Mr. Biden won \u2014 mainly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. More than 30 have been rejected or dropped, according to an AP tally.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have also raised the far-fetched notion that Republican state legislatures in those states could appoint a rival set of electors pledged to Mr. Trump.\n\nBut state Republican leaders have rejected that approach, and it would likely be futile in any case. According to federal law, both chambers of Congress would need to vote to accept a competing slate of electors. If they don't, the electors appointed by the states' governors \u2014 all pledged to Mr. Biden in these cases \u2014 must be used. \n\nThe last remaining move to block the election would be the quixotic effort to vote down the electors in Congress. \n\nThis tactic has been tried \u2014 a handful of congressional Democrats in 2000, 2004 and 2016 objected to officially making both George W. Bush and Mr. Trump president.

The coronavirus was supposed to be her excuse to kick back, relax and use the pandemic as a reason to not worry about hosting holiday events at the White House. But there will be as many as 20 Christmas events this year, despite Covid-19. What I want to know is: Who bullied Melania into doing all this Christmas stuff?\n\nOne of the few joys we\u2019ve had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania\u2019s tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun.\n\nWe know how much she resents this particular part of her duty as first lady. And yet one of the few joys we've had during the Trump administration has been learning how warped Melania's tastes are when it comes to jolly Christmastime fun. Besides being extremely extra in her aesthetic, her White House Christmas decorations have trended Victorian \u2014 but less in the \"A Christmas Carol\" sense, with the waistcoats and bonnets and the carol singing, and more in the \"this mansion is possessed by the ghost of a vengeful spinster abandoned at the altar at Yuletide\" sense.\n\nSangeeta Singh-Kurtz of New York Magazine's The Cut perfectly illustrated this trend Monday when she gave readers a look back at Melania's holiday d\u00e9cor \"ranked from most to least haunted.\" The top slot went to 2018, when the East Wing was ceremoniously lined with blood-red trees, invoking a visceral horror scene.\n\n\nWhile this year's fare is much tamer, it's still worth wondering why she had to go through the trouble at all. This fall, America learned that Melania does not enjoy Christmas, at least not at the White House. We know this thanks to her former friend and staffer Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, whose tell-all book came out in September. In October, she was still making the rounds to promote it. And this time, she came with audio, a conversation with Melania that she'd secretly recorded in July 2018.\n\nIn a clip that aired on CNN, the first lady was heard sounding a lot like her husband as she railed about how the media covers her. She also lamented that she was forced to take charge of the White House Christmas decorations.\n\n\"I'm working like \u2014 my ass off \u2014 on Christmas stuff, you know?\" Melania could be heard saying. \"Who gives a f--- about Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?\n\n\"Then I do it,\" she continued. \"And I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f---ing break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that?\"\n\nWe got precious little time to savor the audio before the 2020 news cyclone swept it away. Within hours of her diatribe's having become public, President Donald Trump announced that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. But we had just enough time to gift us with this banger of a remix from YouTubers The Gregory Brothers.\n\nThankfully, Melania recovered fully, leaving her able-bodied enough to take up the Christmas decoration reins once again. But the question remains: Who's making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic? Is this her just going along with her duty, or was it deemed a political matter and thus outside her ability to turn down?\n\nThose in the West Wing seem to be using the multiple Christmas parties as a final act of defiance, snubbing their noses at the nattering nabobs of negativity who think it's a bad idea to host large events in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nWho\u2019s making Melania do all of this in the middle of a pandemic?\n\n\"If you can loot businesses, burn down buildings, engage in protests, you can also go to a Christmas party. You can celebrate the holiday of Christmas, and you can do it responsibly,\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday.\n\nMelania's chief of staff, former White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham, was a bit more circumspect when asked about safety precautions. \"Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,\" she said. \"It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic d\u00e9cor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.\"\n\n\nAnd it isn't just the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo risked being boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart by his staffers this year. After warning his subordinates at various State Department missions not to hold holiday events, Pompeo is going full Mr. Fezziwig this year; The Washington Post reported that at least 900 invitations have gone out for Pompeo's entirely indoor parties.\n\nAll in all, it's par for the course for this administration. For the last nine months, Trump and his top lieutenants have refused to set any kind of example for Americans looking for some guidance about how to cope with the pandemic. Instead, the administration and the campaign hosted what appear to have been multiple super-spreader events and utterly ignored guidelines for mask-wearing and social distancing. As medical professionals warn against gathering for Christmas, the White House's fetes continue.\n\nSo, who did it? Who bullied the Trump administration's chief anti-bullying advocate into hosting one more year's worth of Christmas stuff? If I had to guess \u2014 and this is, in fact, a total guess \u2014 I'd put my money on White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as being the Ghost of Christmas Present. Meadows, while not running the tightest ship, is big on the schmoozing that Christmas parties in Washington invite. And he's been right there along with Trump in terms of skepticism about preventing the spread of Covid-19, despite having tested positive himself in November.\n\nAh well, this is the last year that Melania will have to worry about being drafted to fight in the War on Christmas \u2014 at least for a while. This time next year, it will be Jill Biden's turn to throw the soirees, but 'til then we'll have to muddle through somehow.", "time": 1607175533.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "This holiday season is different in countless ways. A global pandemic, a fractured presidential transition and baseless claims of voter fraud underscore how chaotic this year has been.\n\nBut one thing rings familiar: The Federal Communication Commission is continuing its tradition of handouts to broadcasters by giving Fox Corporation \u2014 the television conglomerate owned by the Murdochs \u2014 a parting gift before the agency\u2019s GOP leadership heads for the exit. Trump may have soured on Fox since he lost the election, but it seems his FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, has not.\n\nIn early October, Fox filed a request with the FCC for a waiver of the longstanding newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership (NBCO) rule that prohibits one company from owning too many newspapers and TV stations in a single market. The Murdochs need the waiver to continue to own WWOR-TV in New Jersey along with the New York Post. Fox also owns WNYW in New York City, the same metro market as WWOR.\n\nFox has already received multiple temporary waivers of the rule. Now, it\u2019s arguing that a so-called \u201ccloud of regulatory uncertainty\u201d necessitates a permanent waiver. This is laughable, considering how long the Fox situation in New York and New Jersey has gone on \u2014 and how long WWOR has failed to provide local coverage to its New Jersey viewers.\n\nThe NBCO rule dates to 1975, when the FCC determined that having one company own local print and broadcast outlets in the same market would harm localism, diversity, and competition. Broadcast lobbyists like to claim that the rule is outdated because we have the internet now. But the fact remains that local broadcasters and newspapers still generate the vast majority of local-news coverage.\n\nThe fight over these rules will be argued before the Supreme Court next month. Fox has been fighting to get around these diversity protections since it bought WWOR in 2001. And recent events reveal just how far the outgoing Trump FCC might go to sneak in one last favor for Fox.\n\nSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nNever Miss a Beat.\n\nGet our best delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe agency has signaled that it has little interest in examining the actual merits (or lack thereof) of Fox\u2019s October request. Instead, it\u2019s tipping the procedural scales heavily against public participation, signaling that it will grant Fox\u2019s request without allowing adequate time for people from New York and New Jersey to have much of a say in the matter. This move would further erode the media-ownership rules before the Biden administration steps in. And only Fox stands to benefit from all of this.\n\nIn response to Fox\u2019s waiver request, Sens. Bob Menendez and Cory Booker sent a letter to the FCC outlining WWOR\u2019s failures to serve New Jersey while the temporary waivers have been in place.\n\nThough Fox claims that permanently owning both WWOR and the Post would not harm competition or viewpoint diversity in New Jersey, there is a well-documented and decades-long history of WWOR failing to serve New Jerseyans. \n\nPublic-interest advocates have been sounding the alarm about WWOR and have opposed Fox\u2019s series of waivers for years. In 2013, WWOR closed its news department and instead began airing a TMZ-style \u201cnews\u201d program called Chasing New Jersey. Then in September 2018, Fox sold its Secaucus TV station and moved its studio to New York \u2014 an act that Menendez described as \u201cthe final nail in the coffin on any legitimate claim to calling themselves a New Jersey broadcast station.\u201d The letter from Menendez and Booker is just the latest iteration in a long series of requests urging the FCC to examine whether WWOR is meeting its legal obligations to New Jersey.\n\nOn Nov. 10, two powerful House reps \u2014  Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D\u2013New Jersey) and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Mike Doyle (D\u2013Pennsylvania) \u2014 wrote a letter to Chairman Pai demanding that the Commission leave controversial items for the Biden administration to address in adherence with \u201cthe norms set by past transfers of power.\u201d\n\nRather than slow down, the Pai FCC put its pedal down. It placed the Fox waiver proceeding on a sped-up schedule. In the notice, the FCC set a two-week deadline, with opposition to the request initially due the day after Thanksgiving. In response to public pressure from Free Press and others, the agency added half a week to the comment period \u2014 which now wraps up on Dec. 8.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be clearer that Chairman Pai is just trying to ram this waiver through before he cedes power to the incoming administration. This attempt to rush a gift to Fox is the perfectly corrupt exclamation point to this particular FCC\u2019s tenure.

The people with knowledge of his plans asked not to be named because their conversations were private.\n\nMusk, the world's second-wealthiest person behind Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is in Texas frequently already. He spends most of his time between Austin, where Tesla and his tunnel start-up Boring Company have operations, and a coastal village called Boca Chica, home to a SpaceX facility. SpaceX started operating in Texas in 2003.\n\nYou need only follow Musk on Twitter to see his presence in the state, as he often posts photos and videos from SpaceX's test and launch site known as the Starship Production Complex.\n\nCalifornia, often condemned by the super rich for its high tax rates and stiff regulations, has seen an exodus of notable tech names during the pandemic as companies look to cut costs and prepare for a future of distributed work. Musk has been among the loudest critics this year, comparing the state to a championship sports team that's become complacent and developed a \"winning-for-too-long problem.\"\n\nIn May, as businesses across California were forced to remain closed because of the pandemic, Musk tweeted that he was moving Tesla's headquarters and future development from California to Texas and Nevada.\n\nGetting out of California, with the highest income tax in the country, and into Texas, which has no state income tax, could save Musk billions of dollars based on his compensation package awarded in 2018. Musk was granted 101.3 million options (adjusted after a 5-for-1 stock split this year) that vest over time as the company hits certain milestones, including market cap numbers.\n\nTesla's stock has surged 782% in the past year. As of October, Musk had earned awards currently worth about $20 billion before taxes, based on Thursday's close, a portion of the potential total.\n\nImagine no possessions\n\nNailing down where Musk lives at any given time is a challenge because he claims to be selling all \"physical possessions\" and tweeted in May that he \"will own no house.\" Shortly after that, he put several of his California homes up for sale. CNBC was unable to find any public records that suggest he's officially changed his residence, and the White Pages online database still lists his primary address as Los Angeles.\n\nEven the people who know him well and are aware of his general plans to move to Texas say they don't know where exactly he stays when he's there and that he tries to keep those details private.\n\nThe state's top lawmaker, Gov. Abbott, certainly seems to think Musk is making the move.\n\nIn July, Abbott said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that Musk told him he'd gotten a Texas driver's license and is a \"bona fide Texan now.\" Abbott also said Musk was building his next Tesla factory in the state because it would give him the freedom to \"expand the way he wanted to expand.\" When contacted for this story, a spokesperson for Abbott declined further comment on Musk's plans.\n\nTo help lure Tesla's new factory, Austin officials granted the company tens of millions of dollars in property tax breaks. Musk confirmed on the company's second-quarter earnings call in July that the plant would occupy about 2,000 acres 15 minutes from downtown, and would be used to build the Cybertruck, its Semi, Model 3 and Model Y. Musk said the factory will start delivering cars next year.\n\nIn addition to SpaceX and Tesla, Musk's Boring Company has an office in Texas. Seven of the nascent company's 17 job openings on its website are for positions in Austin, and Musk has hinted at building a tunnel there. Boring Company investor Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir and friend of Musk's, recently relocated to the Austin area from Silicon Valley.\n\nFor now, Tesla's headquarters is still in Palo Alto, California, and the company continues to build cars in nearby Fremont. SpaceX's main address is in Los Angeles County at 1 Rocket Road in Hawthorne.\n\nBut Musk's personal financial reasons for leaving California are significant. Under his 10-year compensation package approved in 2018, Musk could earn well over $50 billion in stock and awards in 12 tranches \u2014 he's already reached the fourth. He would have to pay income taxes on the profits when he exercises the options. The top state income tax rate in California is 13.3%. In Texas, it's zero.\n\nMusk's awards started kicking in after the company reached $100 billion in market cap along with specific metrics for revenue or adjusted earnings. Each $50 billion increase in market cap, up to $650 billion in total market value, leads to another payout if met with a revenue or profitability target. The company is already worth over $550 billion, after starting the year well below $100 billion.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the second and third tranches vested, and the fourth was achieved in October, the company said in its latest quarterly report. That equals roughly 33.8 million of the 101.3 million shares. For the package to stay intact, Musk must remain either CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer.\n\nMusk and spokespeople for Tesla and SpaceX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "time": 1607109635.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Even industrial accidents are bigger.

law.\n\nWisconsin's top court, in denying the petition, said the parties could pursue a case in a lower court.\n\nMr Trump's lawyer Jim Troupis said he would immediately file the case in circuit court.\n\n\"It was clear from their writings that the court recognises the seriousness of these issues, and we look forward to taking the next step,\" he said in a statement.\n\nUS election

Supreme Court seeking to invalidate ballots.\n\nIn asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly, Mr Trump had argued that there wasn't enough time to wage the legal battle by starting with a lower court, given the looming December 14 date when presidential electors cast their votes.\n\nSwing Justice Brian Hagedorn joined three liberal justices in denying the petition without weighing in on Mr Trump's allegations.\n\nMr Hagedorn said the law was clear that Mr Trump must start his lawsuit in lower courts where factual disputes can be worked out.\n\nMr Trump filed a similar lawsuit in a federal court on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to Mr Trump's federal lawsuit, there is another one in federal court with similar claims from Sidney Powell, a conservative attorney who was removed from Mr Trump's legal team.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia has completed its second recount \u2014 that's three counts in total since the original number of votes were released.\n\nMr Biden is headed toward victory in Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said on Wednesday, rejecting false claims of fraud in the race.\n\nMr Biden had beat Mr Trump by just over 12,500 votes in Georgia, with Mr Biden receiving nearly twice as many of the record number of absentee ballots as the Republican president, according to the secretary of state's office.\n\nAfter weathering criticism for certifying Mr Trump's narrow election loss to Mr Biden, Republican officials in Georgia are proposing additional requirements for the state's vote-by-mail process, despite no evidence of systemic fraud or irregularities.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger looks up towards the ceiling as he speaks during a news conference\nMr Raffensperger has repeatedly said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the November election.(AP: Brynn Anderson)\nPennsylvania\n\nFresh off another rejection in Pennsylvania's courts, Republicans again asked the US Supreme Court to block Mr Biden's victory in the battleground state.\n\nMeanwhile, the state's lawyers say fatal flaws in the original case mean justices are highly unlikely to grant it.\n\nRepublican US congressman Mike Kelly, of north-western Pennsylvania, and the other plaintiffs are asking the high court to prevent the state from certifying any contests from the November 3 election, and undo any certifications already made, such as Mr Biden's victory, while its lawsuit is considered.\n\nThey maintain that Pennsylvania's expansive vote-by-mail law is unconstitutional because it required a constitutional amendment to authorise its provisions.\n\nMr Biden beat Mr Trump by more than 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, a state Mr Trump had won in 2016.\n\nMost mail-in ballots were submitted by Democrats.\n\nThe state's justices refused Thursday, and Mr Kelly's lawyers promptly refiled the case in the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn the underlying lawsuit, Mr Kelly and the other Republican plaintiffs had sought to either throw out the 2.5 million mail-in ballots submitted under the law or to wipe out the election results and direct the state's Republican-controlled legislature to pick Pennsylvania's presidential electors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe states have until December 8 to resolve election disputes.\n\nAfter that, each state's electors have a further six days to vote by paper ballot before Congress meets to count the electoral votes on January 6.\n\nGot a question about the 2020 US election?\n\nSend us your questions, thoughts, and stories about the 2020 US election.

However, Congress has come to its senses and leaders of both parties have said they'll ignore his impotent veto threat and move forward with the bill as is.\n\nThe final version of the National Defense Authorization Act that will soon be considered by the House and Senate won\u2019t include Trump\u2019s long-sought repeal of the legal immunity for online companies, known as Section 230, according to lawmakers and aides.\n\nKey to this was Senate Armed Services Chair Jim Inhofe pointing out the obvious:\n\n\"First of all 230 has nothing to do with the military.\"\n\nThat's both first of all and last of all. The whole attempt to use the NDAA to attack CDA 230 was just bizarre.\n\nInhofe did say he still thinks that 230 should go, but not as a part of the NDAA. A few other Republicans are finally speaking up as well.\n\nStill, Republicans on Wednesday showed some signs of exasperation with the president\u2019s latest effort.

While he said he understood the president\u2019s frustrations with Section 230, it was not worth imperiling the broader defense bill.\n\n\u201cThe NDAA is so important to the men and women that wear the uniform that this should not be an item to veto the act over,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would hope he would reconsider his position on it.\u201d\n\nAnd Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said his \u201cpreference\u201d would be to pass the NDAA and then address Section 230 separately.\n\nDemocratic critics of Section 230 were equally as annoyed. Remember, Senator Richard Blumenthal has been one of the most vocal critics of Section 230 going back to the time before he was a Senator and when he was stymied in trying to sue Craigslist by Section 230 (he was upset that sex workers use Craigslist, and wanted to blame Craigslist for the fact that sex workers exist).\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a co-sponsor of the only bipartisan bill targeting Section 230 to advance out of committee this Congress, called the veto threat \"deeply dangerous and just plain stupid.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cReforming Section 230 deserves its own debate \u2014 one that I\u2019ve helped lead in Congress, and which I look forward to continuing with a more serious, thoughtful administration in January.\u201d\n\nIn another article, Rep. Frank Pallone stated the obvious:\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone said in a statement that Trump is \"holding a critical defense bill hostage in a petulant attempt to punish Twitter for fact-checking him. Our military and national security should not suffer just because Trump's ego was bruised.\"\n\nThere is still plenty of appetite to attack Section 230.
