I was working at a bar for the first ~six months in iowa and the amount of people who just literally talked shit about corona and didn\u2019t believe in it was insane. My mom lives in a very very very red small town where all the old people would all congregate and drink coffee together, until two people ended up in the hospital. One was in the hospital for three months before he died and the other one is still in there. There\u2019s a bar in the small town who consistently was getting fines for breaking covid regulations and nothing would change. I walked around a grocery store for less than 10 minutes and counted 50 people not wearing a mask. Iowa is fucking crazy. I love Iowa so much but shit like this makes me remember why I got out.", "time": 1607008307.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "I\u2019m sorry but if daddy can\u2019t buy you college or can\u2019t buy you a top position in your dream company, you\u2019re just never gonna amount to anything", "time": 1606930190.0}, {"subreddit": "democrats", "text": "fucking iowa", "time": 1606106409.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Is Iowa finally getting a mask mandate?", "time": 1605555185.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Good.
