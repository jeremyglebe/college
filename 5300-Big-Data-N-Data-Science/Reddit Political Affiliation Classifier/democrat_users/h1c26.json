And even he was like, \u201cwhoa whoa whoa.... easy does it.\u201d  \n\nAbsolutely fucking bonkers.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add: I worked for the elections as an E-pollbook Election Judge this year. Not everyone has to have an \u201cID\u201d (driver\u2019s license) but we can verify a persons Identification in a whole host of other ways. We conduct what\u2019s called Minimum Matching Criteria. A voter can bring one of any items from a list of about 20 or so items with which we can verify their ID. When I look up a voter I match their first, middle, last names, date of birth, address, last 4 of ss#, etc. Lots of other forms of ID are acceptable- pilots license, higher education student ID, birth certificate, passport, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019re a registered voter all that information in the Epoll book system has already been verified and if you\u2019re not in there and you want to register you can bring an acceptable form of ID and a current bill statement (like your water bill) from your current address and we can use that. \n\nThe idea that ANYONE can walk in and vote without ANY confirmation of their Identification is 100% FALSE!! \n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more then offer to work for the elections (for pay!! I made $17.49/hr) and you\u2019ll learn all the ins and outs of how the system works. It was very eye opening!", "time": 1607010310.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Try this.

Basically Krebs did an end run bypassing Congress and fuckface McConnell and had trump sign an order to do some cyber security stuff that essentially gave him pretty wide latitude to implement a lot of countermeasures to deter an outside attack and beef up our election systems without having to go through Congress. He also separately was running an NSA ...DHS(?) website that basically identified and debunked all the of disinfo that trump was constantly spewing, which is part of the reason he was fired because trump found out about it (which I find to be kind of hilarious).  \n\nObviously the podcast goes into a lot more detail but that\u2019s the gist. I\u2019d like to shake Krebs\u2019 hand and buy him a beer.
