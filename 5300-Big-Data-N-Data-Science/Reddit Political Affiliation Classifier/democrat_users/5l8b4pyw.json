I live in the most diverse area in the city. The right try\u2019s to over blow this. Just cuz some Instagram activist girl that might be their niece posted something about no more saying merry Christmas they think this is actually going on. These idiots don\u2019t leave their little towns to find out for themselves.\n\n\nWho in their right mind gets offended by merry Christmas? I love Christmas not religious at all. Santa and Christmas movies are dope. Giving is good \n\nWho in their right mind gets offended by happy holidays.. why would that offended you?", "time": 1607096012.0}, {"subreddit": "democrats", "text": "Exactly they think they care about being justice or morals but they only care about their feelings and emotions not ppl, I don\u2019t care what they tell themselves they really don\u2019t.
