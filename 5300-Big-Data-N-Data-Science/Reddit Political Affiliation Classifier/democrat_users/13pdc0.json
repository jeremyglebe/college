I despise how unimaginative the top brass of the Democratic Party is. They seethe with contempt if you\u2019re to their left and make suggestions of how they can reach younger people, minorities and even the white working class. \n\nYour suggestion, I believe, is an amazing one. In the short term, I wouldn\u2019t expect the democrats to win say Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Ohio, Iowa, West Virginia. But a program like that would probably soften people\u2019s views of the party from \u201cSATANIC PEDO COMMIE PARTY\u201d to \u201cthe PC weirdos who helped me get a job and fed my family a few times\u201d. \n\nSorta off topic but I saw someone on Twitter make a suggestion. They said, Biden, Pelosi and Schumer should go to Georgia and take a bill that would give everyone $2000 a month for a year and have Biden say \u201cI want to sign this bill, but I can\u2019t if Loeffler and Perdue win\u201d. Something like that would kick ass but we\u2019re stuck with \u201cyou can\u2019t be a too ambitious to win over swing voters, you\u2019ll scare them\u201d", "time": 1606957435.0}, {"subreddit": "democrats", "text": "Nothing wrong with welfare.
