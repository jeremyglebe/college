I am going to try explain how these people think.\n\nMy Trumper relatives came for a visit for two days -- a very short trip. \n\nI told them we were having a particularly bad surge and few people wear masks. I also told them that if anyone in my household got COVID they would likely die because our ICUs were full. We don't go out -- at all. We have groceries delivered.\n\nThey decided to meet others from another surge city for lunch at a sit down restaurant. When I turned them down because it \"wasn't safe,\" they lectured me how I was overreacting to the dangers and that I didn't understand how it's really not a big deal.\n\nApparently, because they having been dining indoors in their own hometown, it is perfectly safe to eat is restaurants elsewhere. Open restaurants equals \"safe.\" Also, they think they had it already.\n\nSo here is their logic. You have to understand their *disconnect* between cause and effect. I finally understood it.\n\nIf restaurants are open, then it is safe to eat. The problem isn't that people get sick at restaurants, it's that politicians have closed dining. These two thing in their mind have everything to do with people dying. But they think the restaurants are open because they won some battle *and* if restaurants are open, the pandemic is under control. Closing them is what makes cases soar because that is what happens when the government shuts things down.\n\nMask rules are bullshit -- it has nothing to do with keeping people healthy. They only have to wear a mask because the government requires it, NOT because it keeps people safe. People didn't wear masks before COVID, therefore, masks are the reason we have a pandemic.\n\nThe same logic disconnect applies to things like Hillary's emails. When they said she should be tried for treason, I asked if *anyone* in the administration using private emails should be tried? They said yes, so I asked if that included Ivanka who was doing literally the exact same thing? They simply could not apply the same rules to another situation. They could not understand how Ivanka's email server had anything to do with Hillary since one was under Obama and the Other under Trump. I am serious. Being part of their \"team\" meant their actions could not possibly be corrupt.\n\nThey argued that government single-payer healthcare was \"socialism\", but defended being on Medicare that they were entitled to it. Again, because it served them, it was good.\n\nThis is how they think.", "time": 1606340014.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "It's almost as bad as the ones who think the election was rigged, but only in races Trump lost -- but Dems didn't also screw with Senate races.", "time": 1606336649.0}, {"subreddit": "democrats", "text": "So does that excuse Trump? \"Hitler sucked worse, so. . .\"", "time": 1606320602.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "I have serious doubts he has received the more sensitive intel for years", "time": 1606065231.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "One can hope.", "time": 1606051305.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "I think it's Ivanka because she would be a last defense for Daddy.

He never dealt with this before, he hires lawyers to fight his legal battles. In his mind, it's about losing money because that is what it's always been. When it failed, it was his lawyers fault.\n\nWhile he is a con man, he is also like much  like his base -- stupid and ignorant. \n\nAs an example, McConnell let him believe that the Supreme Court would simply declare him king without understanding anything about the legal process. You can recognize this in his legal flailing about -- he is simply clueless that you have to have evidence. You can see he is demanding they \"file something\" -- which they did.\n\nTrump has skated by without knowledge his whole life. He cheated in school, he lied his way out of military service, he never worked his way up in a business.  He bought his way into everything.\n\nHis base identifies with this. These are the people who believe life is like a team sport -- church is for networking, climbing the ladder means screwing the competition.\n\nThe trouble with that is you don't develop knowledge of how systems work. He was never an elected official so he has zero knowledge of civics. He probably changed the channel when Schoolhouse Rock came on.\n\nYou're dealing with a desperate man who doesn't know how the world works in ANY capacity. He doesn't know how business operates. He sits in his dirty diapers and barks commands at people. He has other more ambitious people around him who connive and scheme so Trump just claims the ideas for himself.\n\nIf you think this man has an inkling the difference between a crime and tort, you are sadly mistaken. The reason his supporters are so stupid and craven is because they identify with him. Look at the idiots around him. Look at his kids. Ivanka managed to bankrupt her clothing line while having the public eye of the US presidency. Think about that level of incompetence.\n\nThis isn't for the sake of being insulting. You need to understand that Trump does not know how business, law, or politics works. He never had to because his money paid for other people to handle the details.\n\nHe doesn't know he is facing *criminal* charges. Even if someone managed to convince him of this, he has absolutely no frame if reference for it. \n\nHe will think he has to pay a fine.\n\nThere is no getting Pence to pardon him *unless* his attorneys are pushing it through to save their own asses. Pence may benefit from the move, so it might happen. But don't forget he is dirty, too and likely to ask for a blanket pardon first and then leave Trump hanging. \n\nBut make no mistake, when Trump is no longer useful, and no longer has money, they will bail, including his kids.
