They don\u2019t value anything but themselves and money. They may not have committed the same level of atrocities, but I absolutely believe they would if they thought they could get away with it.

I agree that in the end Hitler was much much worse, and we must remember the true weight of his crimes. However, my belief is that if they were allowed to - Trump and Stephen Miller would absolutely allow similar atrocities to happen today. They are horrible, extremely racist people who hate anyone who isn\u2019t like them. To me they deserve this awful comparison, and the people who support them and allow them to separate families and cage children deserve to know that they are in the same league with nazis, the people who committed the ultimate atrocities. \n\nSo really my point is not that they are exactly the same, but that the people who support Trump are absolutely the people who would have supported Hitler.
