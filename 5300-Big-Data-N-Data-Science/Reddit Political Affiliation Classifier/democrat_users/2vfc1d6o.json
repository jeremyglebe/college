They quite clearly can be. It would be reasonable to say it\u2019s unlikely and the risk is thought to be mitigated by procedures.\n\nAlso, I can probably fit a memory card and a screwdriver in my dong flap. Are we really gonna argue that one couldn\u2019t access it behind a curtain? Not to say I\u2019d need to, because these machines are regularly left out unsecured before voting starts. I saw a guy in Massachusetts or Michigan I think that goes around and takes pictures of himself with voting machines just hanging out outside a precinct. Also, half of them are connected to the internet despite what the company says.\n\nThese aren\u2019t conspiracies, they are real vulnerabilities that the companies have refused to fix arguing that procedures are sufficient to countermand the exploits. Procedures that are regularly not followed. \n\nIt is my opinion that the voting machine companies are irresponsible and full of shit. They are skirting responsibility to maintain their government funding because admitting vulnerability and fixing it carries risk. It helps that the political climate now is to dismiss these issues for maintaining desired outcome for the vote. It however does not make them go away.\n\nThese machines suck, and they need serious re-work to be used responsibly.", "time": 1606531142.0}, {"subreddit": "democrats", "text": "Agree with the whole dirty sock removal sentiment.
