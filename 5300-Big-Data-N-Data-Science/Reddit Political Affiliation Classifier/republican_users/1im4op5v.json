Trump is very much attempting to \u201csteal\u201d the election. This has been a calculated plan for months. It\u2019s important to remember the timeline leading up to the election:\n\n1. Trump casted doubt on mail in ballots for months, calling them fraudulent.\n2. He worked to sabotage the USPS to hinder their ability to handle the inevitable surge in mailed ballots\n3. He told his supporters to not vote by mail and to instead show up in person on Election Day to vote. (Causing the early polling numbers to favor trump)\n4. Republicans repeatedly blocked legislation that would allow states to expand early voting and allow mail in ballots to be counted early causing the mail in vote to only be counted AFTER polls closed on Election Day in multiple states.\n5. Republicans prioritized and rushed a SC confirmation in the final week before the election ensuring a conservative majority in the court.\n\nRemember trump even admitted his plan to challenge the election using the Supreme Court just a few days before the election. Republicans have known how this would turn out and have been preparing for it all year.

They tried to claim it was over fears of fraud and election interference, and saying that we weren\u2019t prepared enough to deal with massive amounts of mail ballots. They refused and blocked efforts by democrats to actually IMPROVE the system to help solve these issues and eliminate those fears. And THEN they systematically worked to make voting difficult and cripple the postal service in order to sabotage the election process specifically with mail in voting.\n\nThe way we\u2019re watching this election play out is a direct result of the trump administration and the Republican Party, this is clear and obvious to anyone that has been paying attention.\n\nAs an added bonus, this has all been going according to plan for them. Trump has known that the election was not looking good for him. He knew he was facing possibly record turnout in support to get him out of office, and with the push for mail in voting that was definitely possible. This is why he started sowing doubt into the election and about mail in votes very early. It\u2019s why he pushed for his supporters to NOT vote by mail and to instead vote in person on Election Day. It\u2019s why the GOP and trump forced the confirmation of a SC justice during the final week of an election ( which according to them shouldn\u2019t be allowed within a YEAR before an election) instead of focusing on coronavirus relief and ending the pandemic.\n\nTrumps plan since this pandemic started and things started looking bad for him has always been to discredit the mail in and early votes, hope his supporters show up in person on Election Day so that their votes are counted first and seen as more legitimate, and then fight in the courts, all the way up to the Supreme Court which he has now installed justices who he thinks will help him, in order to get mail in ballots thrown out.
