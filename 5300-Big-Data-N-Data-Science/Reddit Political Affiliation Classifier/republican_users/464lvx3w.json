Then wake up the next morning and act surprised that the race didn\u2019t end when I said it did. Millions of people agree. Anybody who kept running after I declared victory cheated. I won the race, by a lot actually. And all of you are liars for going along with the facade that I actually lost the race. \n\nMaybe if we can change the rules so that after I declared victory, nobody else can move, then I\u2019ll be the winner.

Unfortunately for him that\u2019s all allowed under the rules established by the party. Parties used to just nominate a candidate without primaries and let people vote in the general election. Now we have primaries but the parties set the rules, so they have some control over the outcome. \n\nThis year I think they made the right decision. There were 3-5 moderate candidates in the primary and Bernie Sanders 9! the far left (excluding Warren for simplicity sake). 60% of Democrats vote for moderates, but those votes are split among 5 candidates. The other 40% vote far left, but all those votes go to Bernie giving him the nomination. Is that fair? Bernie got the most votes, but more people voted against him than for him? More Democrats are ideologically moderate, their votes were just split among many candidates, so no one candidate reached the number needed to win. (same thing happened in the Republican primary, giving Trump the nomination)\n\nWell, what if we just picked the top moderate candidate and removed the other ones. Vote Biden if you\u2019re moderate and Bernie if you\u2019re \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d. Whichever group turns out more will be the winner.
