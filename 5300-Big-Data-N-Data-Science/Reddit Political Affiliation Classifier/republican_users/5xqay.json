The problem is when people get so bought into an ideology that threre is no conversation to be had. There are many angles to be discussed and reasonable people criticising from all angles is what makes a society function. But I get tired trying to build a better society for everyone when people don\u2019t want to participate. I pay my taxes proud. I have done a good thing.

Together we build something bigger than we can do alone. Taxes fund common service like police, firefighters, military and roads. In more socialist countries than the US like *all of Europe*, taxes also fund education, water & sewage, garbage collection, public transportation, electric infrastructure, postal services and healthcare. That has nothing to do with Stalin or Mao. It is just common sense no matter where you lie on the political spectrum in Europe. Unless, of course, you listen to American right wing media. I have been many times to Miami, and I am quite taken aback how the older generation of Cubans is hard core conservative. I find it very strange. But then again, the poor rural whites vote against the very healthcare they desperately need.

The small towns mourn the brain drain which takes their educated best and brightest to the cities for opportunities that their towns simply cannot have. Hence the cities are often viewed with hostility and are talked about as some liberal hell-holes. This also makes higher education frowned upon as it increases the risk of that flight.
