City wages tend to be higher than rural wages and one's ability to make more money in general increases in cities. So the people leaving \"democratic\" city (this is a silly statement on its own as in most cities people are more liberal) are people that don't have the skills to generate income in cities. They are not able to compete with most workers to generate more income. \n* The price of rentals is based on what people are willing to pay. The only reason that on one side of a city I can rent an apartment for $2000 a month and on the other side of the city I can only rent an apartment for $800 only has to do with what people are willing to pay. \n   * In a more affluent part of town, I can charge more because the people living in those areas are skilled laborers. \n   * In a less affluent part of town, I can't charge as much because unskilled laborers don't earn enough money to live in the apartment at $2000 a month. \n   * The market decides what I can rent an apartment for, not me, and not the government.\n* Some reasons someone in a blue state would leave it is unbelievable inexpensive retirement real estate in red states, that they are unskilled and can't compete financially or they have 'made their money' in the blue state and want to have a slower type of lifestyle. Less work, less money, but with a home they can buy outright with the money they earned in the blue states. \n* Even under Trump blue states have had a higher wage growth than red states.\n* Generally speaking we folks in the blue states never even think about red states and we are not talking about a mass exodus here. There are some people that want to move out of blue states but it isn't like we are rushing to leave. My job in my blue state pays me around $70,000 more a year than I can make in any red state I looked my job role up in. It would be stupid for me to leave.

I'm not a democrat and I judge people based on their own records and comments. \nIt is clear that Trump has an honesty problem, this is well documented and isn't really up for debate. I don't like liars, I don't tolerate them in my life or as my leaders. There are other criticism I have of Trump that I think are equally valid. \n\nLike the way he talked about McCains service, in my opinion that was well below what I would accept from any of my friends, or my leaders. \n\nBut even those opinions don't mean that everything Trump has done is bad. I don't think that at all. So whoever you think you are talking to, it clearly isn't me. \n\n\"However, for all your long winded response the only thing I needed to read was the fact you said Trump said Covid was a hoax\"\n\nThis is unfortunate because I have a lot to say and if that is the metric with which you will decide what is worth listening to you will have a very short field of view.", "time": 1604348194.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "I really don't like Trump but people only violate the law if they are found guilty of a crime.

And lets not fail to mention New Zealand is in one of their worst economic recessions since ever. So maybe they did well with Covid but at what cost? Many more will now suffer because of what they did to their economy and how long will it take for them to recover? So your country is far from a great example. Try again.\" \n\n25 deaths is a great example. Economies recover, dead people don't. Not to mention that New Zealand has had great social programs to help people during this recession, so it isn't really the same as millions of American's out of work with zero help from their government. I'm surprised that you don't find New Zealand's example something to aspire to. Fewer deaths and a better government handling of assistance to the citizenry.", "time": 1604345624.0}, {"subreddit": "republicans", "text": "\"1. I guess my statement seems invalid to you but that doesn't make it so.\"\nYou are absolutely correct. But that you find it valid also doesn't make it so. So we can likely agree on that. \n\n\"2. And talking about war is a different thing. Support for Vietnam war was fairly high initially. Im sire they spun it that way too. Only years later did the actual truth come out. But again it's not the same.\"\n\nIf it is logically consistent it doesn't matter what the topic is, it will be consistent regardless of the content. The consistency is in using your logic which I take to mean, \"I don't have an issue with a president being positive.\" If you think that being positive while American soldiers are dying and calling those deaths a hoax then you do have an issue with a president being positive. \n\nThe way this works is like this; I make a statement, \"I don't consider killing someone in self defense to be murder.\" To be consistent we need to be able to agree with in like but different scenarios, as such; Someone is trying to kill you will and axe and you kill them with a gun murder? No. Someone is trying to kill you will their hands and you kill them with a gun is that murder? No. This is logical consistency. \n\n\"You know for a fact positive attitudes can help in recovery from illness and the like.\" Again I agree with you, but we are not talking about helping people recover from an illness, we are talking about preventing people from getting an illness. These are two different things, obviously. \n\n\"Again you can't control a virus. Every year we don't control the flu and you know that.\"\n\nThis is somewhat misrepresenting this virus as we have plenty of risk management for the flu. We have regular vaccinations, many people have preexisting antibodies and we understand how to treat it. When you don't know about a risks existence there are was to prevent it from becoming a \"threat\". I work in IT security, we don't know about every threat that will come into existence. We do however had a lot of ways to identify and prevent the spread of computer viruses and malware that we are unaware of at the time. Then we contain it and identify it. It seems like Trump failed to perceive the threat while ignoring the risk. Risk management is basically the same across all disciplines so it isn't like there wasn't a opportunity to handle this event better. Again other countries have done a much better job controlling the virus. Going from high cases to extremely low cases. It is possible, it just doesn't seem to be in the U.S. \n\n\"The reason you don't see the correlation is because it doesn't fit your opinion of Trump or the narrative you want to follow. Maybe because of sever TDS\" I think the fact that I know a great deal about risk management and how to unbiasedly analyze data, as I did above should show you that this isn't about a narrative I want to follow. \n\n\"But I get it. You had a flat tire, blame Trump. It rained or didn't rain, blame Trump. TDS at its worse. You can't get past the fact he won the election and yet your side talks about accepting election results when in 4 years your side hasn't.\" This isn't my position at all and I'm not sure how you could had gotten it from anything I said. Perhaps you are trying to fit me into a narrative that you have already predefined for me? I can tell you this is not how I think about the world. \n\n\"Thinking the president could have done more or better about Covid is simply an opinion. There are no facts to back up this opinion. And our opinions differ. Leave it at that and try to gaslight or bully a 12 year old on another thread.\" \n\nAgain this is incorrect. We have examples of what could have been done and years of risk management, specifically with how to handle pandemics to show you might not know what you are talking about here. In the world right now there are countries that have done better than the U.S. in terms of containment of the virus and distribution of adequate information. We know what those countries did. If the Trump administration had the opportunity to act in a different manner and didn't, we would generally call that negligence or not responding to a threat. It appears like the Trump administration had access to all of the facts but chose not to act on them. The positive president comment is a representation of this. No one in charge of a pandemic would ever recommend that you dishonestly relay information to a population. Trump did this, and he has admitted so. \n\nForgive any typo's here, I am running out of time for lunch at work. \nLast  two questions... \n\nIs there anyway you think you could be wrong about your opinion? \nIs it a possibility that you don't know enough about the subject to have an educated opinion on the topic? \n\nThanks for your time.", "time": 1604344378.0}, {"subreddit": "republicans", "text": "lol because it was a fake the OP took down the post.", "time": 1604341975.0}, {"subreddit": "politics", "text": "Hillary Clinton is a poor loser and the NY Times and Democratic strategist continually bring up this junk like it means anything.   \nClinton lost an election to Donald Trump, think about that for a second.

If we use this logic for another situation is is still okay? Here is an example; The President knew that sending military troops into a country would cause 230,000 American deaths. He was positive about it and said everyone would be safe and we had nothing to worry about. He went on to say that, not only don't we have anything to worry about but all of the news you are hearing to the contrary is just a hoax. In a situation like this would you still be okay with a logically consistent example like the above? \n\n\"A lot of people, including experts, said many conflicting thing.
