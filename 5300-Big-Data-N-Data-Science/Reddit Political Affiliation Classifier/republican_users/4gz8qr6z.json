But if i must...\n\nIn the first few elections, the US noticed an issue with the balance of power.  They noticed the dense cities tended to have a very different perspective than the rural states.  Both served important roles and needed to remain unified as more than just trade partners.  Also being unified made them a stronger force for opposing threats.  Even though most of the cash crops were farmed in the rural southern states, they were underrepresented in policy.  States like RI also had no voice in the US.  This country was founded on everyone having a voice, but this was not the case.  Dense populations have different needs than rural, but both need equal representation to keep the balance (trade, power, policy, etc.). Up to the civil war, dense population states wanted more power because they had more people.  They tried to use this to leverage the southern states to change their policies.  The tension and lack of representation lead to the south attempting to succeed from the US.  It\u2019s pretty obvious today how local community/grass roots propaganda play into how each person votes.  If we remove the electoral college and hand the power to the dense populations, it will eventually severely damage our economy and possibly lead to a 2nd civil war.  Dense populations like California and New York will make all of the rules.  The under representation will lead to tension.  The entire middle will attempt to succeed from the US.  You say no big deal, the US military will stop that.  We found in the first civil war that southern soldiers fought for the south.  Theres a lot of holes in my giant 1 paragraph summary.
