Being so I didn't think so much of Trump for most of his term including the start of 2019 due to his infidelity insulting others etc. some Catholics and Christians from other denominations don't have problems with that, although true Catholics would.\n\nThat being said, this is not so much about me supporting Trump as being against the overwhelming deception of the media and various left groups to brainwash the people to accept their ideologies that would ultimately destroy this country and religious freedom as we know it, think the CCP Facade for example.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind, or should there be for any sane person, that this election was stolen, the evidence has become insurmountable. Covid 19 has been weaponized to force complacence among the people and you have other leaders such as Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau even stating that the \"pandemic provided an opportunity for a reset\".\n\nSo in short, even though I don't personally approve of Trump, he is the only hope against the oncoming communist agenda. Yes COMMUNIST AGENDA! That is what is coming if this election is allowed to be stolen, we will never see a free and fair election again if this is allowed unless something drastic and tragic such as a civil war takes place. The cost later to fix this would be too great so it must be fixed now to ensure it never happens again ! Additionally, the amount of resistance Trump saw from the left during his term would pale in comparison to what Biden would see since for most people he would have won only through multiple acts of treason.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nOne great positive that has come from his term though has been in forcing those hiding deceptively in the shadows to expose themselves openly. They have become so enraged that reason no longer applies to them and the same can be said for much of the Catholic hierarchy as we Catholics truly see them for what they are now.", "time": 1606331050.0}, {"subreddit": "republicans", "text": "\ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udcc8 HARD EVIDENCE \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcca, \n\nVotes switched from Trump to Biden, totals for 50 states: [archive.is/H79VF](https://archive.is/H79VF),   \nGW Pundit article released on the previous link: [tinyurl.com/y6pezac3](https://tinyurl.com/y6pezac3),   \nDeep Analysis from Dr. V.A.
