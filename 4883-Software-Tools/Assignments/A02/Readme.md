The software tool I have found is Web2Exe (and its close cousin, Electrify)

### Web2Exe
https://github.com/jyapayne/Web2Executable
I chose this software tool because in the past few semesters I have gotten pretty good with javascript. I initially found this tool while
working on a phaser game and investigating how it could actually be published on PC (using platforms such as Steam). I like it because it
is multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) and handles some of the more mundane things for you (created an icon for the program). It allows
for you to develop desktop software using web code.

### Electrify
https://github.com/jyapayne/Electrify
This software is a version of Web2Exe made by the same guy in order to do the same thing with electron instead of nodejs.
