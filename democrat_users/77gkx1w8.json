That's especially so since the GOP strategy is to run this the way they always have lately - Southern and Midwestern states actually respond best to for Democrats is localisation - i.e. SC issues for SC, Joe Cunningham for Lowcountry, (I know she lost but with her gains) Theresa Greenfield who knows Iowa farmers and crop prices etc. What the GOP wants more than anything is to try to nationalize it - which they did successfully for both races. They tried to erase Joe Cunningham and Greenfield and tried to make it race against AOC and Pelosi and the DNC instead. Biden coming in too early feeds that narrative and distracts from what Warnock and Ossoff are presenting. And the biggest drive of a high profile name like Biden coming in is enthusiasm - which is where GOTV it becomes worth it but before then, most of the people who would see that rally already know to vote day 1 of mail in voting anyway. \n\nAlso, truth be told, high-profile surrogate trips are a trade-off. They can draw a lot of attention but, especially with someone like the President-elect in a state with a lot going on right now, it takes an enormous amount of time and money - dozens and dozens of staff that could be working on a lot of voter contact or building the supports for voter contact or even 10 other big surrogates in that time, will be pulled to work on a visit like that, plus a bunch of resources. \n\nAnd in impact, a lot of that will be limited by the fact that we're still in a place doing drive in rallies with, at best, a couple hundred people, not the thousands that they would normally have.", "time": 1607078558.0}, {"subreddit": "democrats", "text": "Especially some places I see it. \n\nLook I get that some places feel they need guns for safety but sir, this is a Whole Foods in Palm Beach.
