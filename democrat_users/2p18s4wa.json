Everybody had their hand in it on the Democratic side to rig the election.

Although Trump maybe the first President or the most famous to coin the term fake news it's only been a secret to people that follow very limited news sources. People have woken up these past four years and a lot of the swamp has been drained. There's still people in China that believe everything state run news throws at them. But the ones that find out they've been lied to are against the CCP and learned to vpn and find the real news when the state puts out propaganda.
