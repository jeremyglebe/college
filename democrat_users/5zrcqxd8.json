What I'm personally doing is getting an absentee ballot, but rather than mail it in, I'm bringing it back to the elections office directly. I hope a huge portion of Dems voting by absentee ballot do that, if their state allows it. I hope Dem voters in states that allow early voting to take advantage of that as much as possible. If we get a huge percentage early voting that could help tremendously. I also hope that more Republicans decide to vote by mail, which would blunt the effect of an election night where Trump looks like he won because they haven't counted mail-ins. And maybe in places where the lines are not too long, I hope that, yes, some more Dems vote in person, if they can socially distance and feel safe. Furthermore, we need to apply public pressure for the USPS to prioritize election ballots and get them back in time, for the GOP Senate to pass the funding for the USPS that the House passed, for states to extend election deadlines, for the media to refuse to start showing results until mail-ins are counted, for the media to make it clear that we probably won't know the election winner the night of the election.
