Even though Max has tried to say he\u2019s both for BLM *and* Blue Lives Matter (against police defunding), the message didn\u2019t resonate well with his mostly Republican leaning constituents, given how there\u2019s a notable percentage of police officers who live in the island/borough. So that was most likely the primary reason he lost. \n\nI do hope he can stick around in some fashion! Since he\u2019s still in the Army National Guard, he\u2019s still serving the country in one way or another, and there\u2019s speculation his time in politics isn\u2019t completely over given NYC\u2019s mayoral elections are next year, and he\u2019s floated to announce a run soon, according to rumors.", "time": 1607018404.0}], "republican_score": 0, "democrat_score": 3}
