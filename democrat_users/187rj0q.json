I will try to keep all my questions to Trump voters respectful.\n\nFirst of all, I don't like all of Biden's policies either.  I'm not a progressive.  I'm a moderate conservative by nature, but I've abandoned the Republican party in the Trump era.  Centrist Democrats like Biden are the best match for me in terms of policy.  But my concerns about Trump go much deeper than policy.  Policies can be changed after the next election.  I think the damage Trump is doing is far more irreversible.\n\nHere are a few questions...  None of which are about specific policies.\n\n1). All politicians lie, but Trump's complete indifference to telling the truth is truly historic and unprecedented.  Do you disagree, or care?  Personally I mute my TV whenever Trump is speaking because I don't want to accidentally remember and believe one of his lies.\n\n2). I believe that Trump has been slowly destroying the competence of the federal government, by replacing competent career professionals with anti-science donors who's only \"leadership\" qualifications are personal loyalty to Trump.  Do you disagree?  Do you care?  (Pandemic response is just the most obvious of many examples)\n\n3). The Republican ideals of limited government, fiscal responsibility, and other ideas old-school Republicans used to talk about seem to have been completely replaced by a cult of personality to one person.  Does this bother you?\n\n4). Some people, myself included, believe Trump's aggressive dismantling of all checks and balances will lead to just another banana republic dictatorship, no better than Russia, China, or even so-called socialist dictatorships like Venezuela or Cuba.  I personally believe Trump will make us resemble those failed so-called \"socialist\" countries far more than the Democrats.
