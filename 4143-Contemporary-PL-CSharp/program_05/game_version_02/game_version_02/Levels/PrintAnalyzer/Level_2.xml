      <Line>theBigCheese> Hey rookie. I hear its your first time on the job.</Line>
      <Line>theBigCheese> I'll guide you through this one.</Line>
      <Line>theBigCheese> Basically, you're looking for fingerprints.</Line>
      <Line>theBigCheese> Hold on a minute, my secretary is talking to me.</Line>
      <Line>theBigCheese> Nevermind, I gotta go. Ned, help them.</Line>
      <Line>*theBigCheese has disconnected*</Line>
      <Line>Forensics4Life> Just guess where one of the fingerprints is.</Line>
      <Line>Forensics4Life> If you guess the wrong space, you'll get an arrow pointing towards a fingerprint.</Line>
      <Line>Forensics4Life> If you guess right, the analyzer will mark it '@'.</Line>
      <Line>Forensics4Life> Good luck.</Line>
      <Line>not_a_secret_agent4242> Don't screw it up, rookie.</Line>
      <Line>Forensics4Life> Oh, and you have limited guesses before the evidence gets messed up so watch that.</Line>
      <Line>not_a_secret_agent4242> Shut up, Ned.</Line>
