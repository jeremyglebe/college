  <!-- 
  Game Rules:
    All Search Analyzer levels (The DNA Sample finding game) require the
    following elements:
      goal - one or more samples that must be found to win, marked with 'X'
        (in game the goals should appear as '~', so fake samples should also
        be marked with a '~')
      start - starting position of the investigator, marked with an 'i'
  General:
    Every line of the grid must end with a '\', this character will not show
    in the actual game. 
    Whitespace is ignored, use '`' to denote a blank space in the grid.
