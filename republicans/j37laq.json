You could think that Obama is a better man but wouldn\u2019t vote for him as you don\u2019t want the dems in power. I think we all know who you would vote for.\n\nAlso try to somewhat separate the man from his political views, of course they affect each other but don\u2019t just think well trump and I agree on more issues there for his is automatically a better man.\n\nBy good man, I\u2019m asking about his character. Do you think he possesses virtues, do you think he is a good role model would you be happy if your child started to behave like him?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j37laq)"}
