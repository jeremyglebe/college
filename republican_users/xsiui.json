I was on LittleGreenFootballs, Powerline, AceOfSpades, various wordpress and blogs by randos who are now influencers on Twitter. I cut my teeth on the 1996 election and really got into it during the 2000 election because I served under Bill Clinton and wanted to make sure that a democratic candidate never saw office again. Reddit at that time was a libertarian hive mind and much more tolerable.\n\nNonsense! Reddit was not around at the time! LGF is a mess.  \n\nI cut my teeth listening to Imus, Rush, and NPR, reading the mainstream sources, and debating politics *in person*. After the 2000 election I got into trolling the other side, mostly at the Democrat Underground website. \n\nThere's no perfect path forward for Trump. The **only** viable path I'm seeing seriously considered is an unfaithful elector scheme to keep the White House. So you take the WH back, what then? You'll be hated. POTUS will have no mandate, Democrats win the Senate and more House seats in 2022, and then a Socialist takes the presidency in 2024. Is that what you want? Because that's what a scheme to hand Trump the presidency through faithless electors will produce.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nJust to make it clear. The only path forward for Trump is not a sure thing. The only thing it guarantees for us is a unified base, one unified against the media and in favor of Trump. Are you planning to pay $5.99 per month for Trump TV just so you can get your news  from an information bubble?  People say it's not just a great information bubble, but the best! No one has ever seen anything like it. Tremendous! That appears to be the end game. \n\nSo destroy what remaining confidence there is in the process, hand over the government to the radical left with majorities that may exceed what Obama had in 2010, and watch the electoral college get abolished among other things. The best thing for us to do right now is to MOVE ON. Trumpism is bigger than Trump. It took a Trump to get us here.
