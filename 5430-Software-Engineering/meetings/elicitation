Met with code geeks discussed on their project (sports management system)
It is a web application with admin and user pages
As part of the frontend; login and registration pages are created
There will be a discussion portal and calendar to show ongoing and upcoming events
HTML, CSS, and javascript are being used for the development
backed will be java spring-boot and MySQL
planning to deploy it on cloud
Improvements suggested by wizard monkeys:
         To add a portal that helps users to look for personal trainers and coaches 
         To use microservices which makes it easy to scale the application 
Improvements suggested by code geeks:
          To use buttons and give full controls to users so that user can experience the game at its best
