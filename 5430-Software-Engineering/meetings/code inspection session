Feedback received during the code inspection session:
Our pair member suggested that we should declare variable name clearly, such as nw=northwest, this could make sense.
We declare the variable name:
nw = northwest, n = north, ne = northeast, w = west, e = east, sw = southwest , s = south ,se = southeast.
