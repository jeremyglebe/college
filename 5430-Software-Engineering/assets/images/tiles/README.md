-------- READ ME ---------

Thank you for downloading Kam's Hero Tiles! This is a collection of hex tiles built for the Hex Kit Tool or any hex tile editor that allows for custom tiles. You don't need to pay me anything to use this pack, go ahead and use it for whatever you'd like. Crediting me is always nice BTW. What I would like is that if you manage to make anything nifty with these assets, upload an image of it onto the itch.io page for the pack(https://lordkameron.itch.io/kams-hero-tiles).

In the meantime if you wanna see what I'm up to check out my Twitter: @CasualKameron or hit me up on Discord: lordkameron
