Today, I got a weird email telling me congratulations, however, the secret service is requesting additional information for all attendees.  It then has you click thru to a page asking for legal name, DOB, and SSN.  \n\nDoes this seem sketch yo you guys?  Has anyone else seen this before? I want to go but am feeling sketched out about giving my SSN over eventbrite to an NBC News event."}
