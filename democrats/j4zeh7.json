However we are learning a lot about the kinds of people and organizations and nations that can confront big problems and turn the tide against them during the pandemic.  \n\nIf you cannot be counted on to do the simple things to avoid exposure or exposing others to COVID19 despite people in all communities suffering and dying from it every day I cannot see how you can be counted on to do anything positive to turn the tide of climate change.  That problem is more immense, amorphous and complicated than COVID-19.  \n\nIf you choose not to understand COVID you aren\u2019t going to choose to understand climate change.  And it\u2019s something you have to choose to understand, believing it is a hoax is a choice you\u2019re making to justify your own continued, convenient for you, behavior.  It is a selfish choice.  But it doesn\u2019t matter what your choice is, it\u2019s happening nonetheless.  It\u2019s not an opinion.  \n\nYou have to accept that changes you make in your life have an effect on people, one you can\u2019t see, one that isn\u2019t an immediate or even a medium term benefit for you.  It\u2019s a change, it\u2019s a bet on humanity you\u2019re making.  \n\nCovid is a big problem, but it isn\u2019t nearly as big as climate change.  We have to understand and accept our actions today affect others both locally and globally and we are all in this together.   We have to pull the rope in the same direction."}
