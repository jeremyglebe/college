One parent is American, the other is Canadian. I had only heard of DACA when tRump had already put an end to new applicants. It pains me being of age to vote (19) but yet still not able to because of circumstances out of my control.\nI'm tired of being punished for something I wasn't even old enough to decide on and thats why I'm urging everyone to vote Biden.\nI'm sure there are other people lurking on this sub who feel the same way."}
