Can you imagine that the kidnap of a Republican Governor or Senator would be treated so lightly?  \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-militia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/us/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-militia.html)\n\nYou just don't target high profile public representatives for money, you're doing it for political purposes, especially when you're already a member of a highly political and radicalized insurgency group. So by the very definition of terrorism this sounds like text book domestic terrorism to me.  \n\nLet's hope these anti-American insurgents will be identified and prosecuted appropriately under government with Biden/Harris leadership.  Oh the 2A folks will lose their freakin' minds over it but this is no part of protecting the State, the very opposite of it.  Your 2A rights end as soon as you dabble in the \"very fine people\" arts of terrorism, sedition, and insurgency."}
