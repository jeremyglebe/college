Bush should endorse Biden. \n\nI despised Bush, and Cheney even more. But they clearly don't care for Trump, want nothing to do with him, and seem to quietly loathe him. I don't understand the 40 +/- percent still supporting Trump, but I'd bet there is a small percentage that were at least W republicans, and probably though even smaller, Reagan. Maybe some of them have been hypnotized by the current atmosphere of the right, caught up in the flow of traffic, so to speak. But an official endorsement of George Jr. could potentially snap those folks out of their mindlessness, their sleepwalking. It could serve as a signpost of how far their party has drifted, completely abandoning the principles of conservatism. We should push for a George W. Bush endorsement!"}
