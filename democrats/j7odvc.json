I process the mail, meaning I load unsorted mail into a sorter. I sort hundreds of thousands of pieces of mail during my shift and I can tell you that the Democratic mail in FL is non-existent. The amount of Republican mail is tremendous. Easily 10 times that of democratic mail. It comes in the forms of packets, fliers, etc and it's almost all entirely Republican. Where is the democratic push in Florida? Florida is a key state to win. Where is the money for FL being spent? TV ads?"}
