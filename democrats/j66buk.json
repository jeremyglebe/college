He made this video as a plea to congress to come to a bipartisan deal to bail out the airlines, because he was notified that he would be furloughed on October 1st.\n\nThis basically comes down to the lack of a COVID relief bill. The worst part is that congress won't meet until October 19th due to all the COVID everyone has, which basically guarantees that everybody will be furloughed. If you thought unemployment was bad before, it's going to be super bad.\n\nThere's still a chance that if some legislation were to pass in like the next two days, this could be prevented. If you feel like it, maybe you could retweet or something to help spread his message."}
