In any case, I'm serious.  I've already given more to Biden / Lincoln Project / Jaime Harrison than I've ever given to anyone during an Election year, but I can do a bit more.\n\nBased on the number of people now coming out of that Rose Garden ceremony with positive tests, there were probably a WHOLE BUNCH of already infected people at the event, which assured that there was active virus all over the place for a very effective spread.\n\nAnd why?  Because trump has led in a culture of unconcern about the reality and seriousness of the virus, and it is HIS LEADERSHIP that created this destructive situation.\n\nJust wait till his lies about Climate Change (and so many other issues) become (more) clear.\n\nHe needs to go.  America doesn't need that kind of Leadership."}
