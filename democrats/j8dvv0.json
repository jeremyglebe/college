{"title": "'It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build A Lasting Majority In American Politics' by Prof David Faris is a book every Democrat needs to read", "score": 2, "id": "j8dvv0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j8dvv0/its_time_to_fight_dirty_how_democrats_can_build_a/", "num_comments": 1, "created": 1602331561.0, "selftext": "> It\u2019s time to do more than protest\u2014it\u2019s time to fix a broken system\n\n> The American electoral system is clearly falling apart\u2014as evidenced by the 2016 presidential election. In It\u2019s Time to Fight Dirty, David Faris offers accessible, actionable strategies for American institutional reform which don\u2019t require a constitutional amendment, and would have a lasting impact on our future.\n\n> With equal amounts of playful irreverence and persuasive reasoning, Faris describes how the Constitution\u2019s deep democratic flaws constantly put progressives at a disadvantage, and lays out strategies for \u201cfighting dirty\u201d though obstructionism and procedural warfare: establishing statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico; breaking California into several states; creating a larger House of Representatives; passing a new voting rights act; and expanding the Supreme Court.\n\n> The Constitution may be the world\u2019s most difficult document to amend, but David Faris argues that many of America\u2019s democratic failures can be fixed within its rigid confines\u2014and, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, he outlines a path for long-term, progressive change in the United States.\n\nThis is a book that I really think every Senate Democrat and Biden team member should read. If I had the money I would buy a few hundred copies and send them them to every Democratic Senator and the Biden campaign. Does someone want to setup a fundraiser?\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/think/video/it-s-time-for-democrats-to-fight-dirty-1226072643531\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?443917-1/its-time-fight-dirty\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Its-Time-Fight-Dirty-Democrats/dp/1612196950\n\nhttps://www.mhpbooks.com/books/its-time-to-fight-dirty/\n\nhttps://blogs.roosevelt.edu/dfaris/its-time-to-fight-dirty/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/davidmfaris\n\nhttps://blogs.roosevelt.edu/dfaris/"}
