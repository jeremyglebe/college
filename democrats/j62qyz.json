However, my Democrat-registered voter information was filed under the wrong name and in the wrong county, even though I have voted every 2 years since 2008. I had to change my name on my registration and put it under the right address. \n\nSorry if this has been posted a million times, I just wanted to share my experience.\n\nAlso to be noted: the address was not one that I was ever associated with, it was completely irrelevant to me and everyone I know."}
