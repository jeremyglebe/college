I\u2019ve been told that I might be picked to ask President Trump a live question at the event, but I\u2019m struggling to come up with what I want to ask. Let me be clear\u2014I am not a fan of Trump. \n\nI want to ask a question that puts him on the spot but that also makes it both hard for him to dodge and that cannot easily be dismissed by conservatives. I also think that there\u2019s been plenty of COVID related questions. I figured this community could help me out with picking a couple possible questions.\n\nWith that said, if you could ask Trump one question, what would it be?\n\nEdit: I wrote \u201clove\u201d instead of \u201clive\u201d by accident originally"}
