DCP is part of the Kids Wear Crowns, a multimedia and entertainment blog focused on providing the perspective of Black Millennials.\n\n We've had the pleasure of interviewing several state politicians in Georgia, including Sa Park, who was recently featured in the keynote address at this year's DNC. \n\nOn Friday, we have the pleasure of interviewing Senator Jones, who is facing a challenging re-election campaign in Alabama. This is important to us because half of KWC is from Alabama and all of us have lived there at some point in time.\n\nWe wanted to also be able to crowd source our questions, to be able to let people submit questions for us to ask Senator Jones, on top of what we've got ready to go.\n\nThe link is below, please submit your questions here. We'll be live on Facebook (The Kids Wear Crowns), Twitter/Periscope (@TheKwCBlog) and the YT link below.\n\n\n[Link to interview with Senator Jones on YouTube](https://youtu.be/wPbBOUTk-8o)"}
