The five House races I found that can be flipped most easily are:\n\nCO-03 Diane Mitsch Bush\n\nVA-05 Cameron Webb\n\nMI-03 Hillary Scholten\n\nTX-24 Candace Valenzuela\n\nOH-01 Kate Schroder\n\nThese races are within reach of winning, all are Republican held seats, and the list of candidates is EXCELLENT-- all diverse (women and/or minority).\n\nBriefly, I took 538.com's House odds, selected the most competitive races, and went to [OpenSecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org/) to find out how much money each candidate raised and has spent. I quickly made a Spreadsheet and came up with a metric to determine how far a dollar raised could go in swinging the race.\n\nSee my Twitter post here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/BlueWyoming/status/1313936187086655488](https://twitter.com/BlueWyoming/status/1313936187086655488)\n\nAnd a more technical explanation of how I selected these here:\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/fivethirtyeight/comments/j6yt6i/what\\_house\\_races\\_to\\_donate\\_to\\_based\\_on\\_the\\_538/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivethirtyeight/comments/j6yt6i/what_house_races_to_donate_to_based_on_the_538/)"}
