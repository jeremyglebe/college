Me personally, while I find the actions of China to be 'not dismissable' for a lack of a better term, I focus on other issues like climate change and the COVID-19 outbreak. Putting aside his tweets, I'm trying to find out in good faith what exactly has the administration done with regards to China and their recent activity? I guess I'm trying to understand why China 'should be #1' in my list of concerns when voting, as others have mentioned.\n\nPerhaps it would help first in answering if you first talk about what China did and then link to what the US has done in response to what China did. I'm just trying to assess the situation and find out stuff."}
