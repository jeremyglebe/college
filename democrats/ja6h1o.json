Just seeing Republicans bitching about wearing masks the entire time really tired me out. Literally every time my dad has to put one on he has to make some sort of philosophical statement or something, like will you just shut the hell up already? I would never say that. I will never say anything until I move out, but just standing by and observing everything, it really opened my eyes up to a lot of things Republicans are about, or maybe they\u2019ve morphed into over trump. And conspiracy theories that COVID is a political move, it will all be over when the election is over. There\u2019s so many things. There\u2019s many other things to cause me to do this, but this was the main thing that made me realize I belong on the other side of things. I\u2019d probably be considered more of a moderate democrat, but honestly I just like to read about economics and politics and not side about a lot of my stances yet. Oh yeah, and because of that, drives me nuts Republicans disregard science. Also, it\u2019s weird how they think a lot of the Trump tax cuts, or any red tax cut, actually affects them in any significant way compared to the wealthy. I can literally see via policy it didn\u2019t affect my family much at all. But I digress. Quietly voting Biden 2020."}
