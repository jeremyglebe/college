I am assuming other Wisconsin residents (at the very least) are receiving similar emails.\n\nHaving that email topped with GOP political fliers is not exactly what I expected when I signed up for the federal service.  It is bad enough that I have gotten four GOP sent absentee applications I did not request, along with the rest of the political junk mail.  Now I have the GOP using the USPS to directly campaigning to me in my email as well.\n\nNext time the USPS should at least try to keep an air of neutrality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c05nknleuhr51.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=684d54dfa117ded31759014d5606878aa3cc4571"}
