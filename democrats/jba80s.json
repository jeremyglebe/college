My mailbox is stuffed with mailers from the Judicial Crisis Network, an org that funnels money into shaping the Supreme Court and lower courts with ultra conservatives do that they can mold America in their fundamentalist image. Is their any way I can stop receiving these or at the very least receive some democratic mailers to balance things out. I\u2019ll happily take political mail from the Democratic Party or Joe Biden of it means I don\u2019t have to look at mail referencing Amy Coney Barrett and how she\u2019ll \u201csave America\u201d every single day."}
