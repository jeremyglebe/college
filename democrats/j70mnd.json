He asked me a few minutes ago why I do not like the republican party in a few points. There are plenty of reasons why I disagree with them but my two big points were the bailouts that large companies and billionaires got, before and during the pandemic; and the history of systemic racism and racial bias that occurs in their policies. \n\nI am requesting any reports and data to support(or debunk) these claims they can be from any website or database you believe is trustworthy. I will be doing my own reading as well, but I figured I could count on some assistance. Thank you very much for your time."}
