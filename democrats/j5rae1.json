I really think that if more moderate conservatives just *heard* the things he believes, they probably wouldn't be so into him. I'm thinking I'd put these \"counter-signs\" beside the Trump/Pence ones.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with printing out political signs and erecting them on street corners? Have you seen anything similar to this? I have no experience but I'm willing to burn some money on it.\n\nI've looked at a few websites and they quote 2' x 3' signs at $20-30 each."}
