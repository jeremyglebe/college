I think that\u2019s the primary reason why he wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize so bad - it infuriates him that Obama won it.  Well, not only did he not win the award this year, he lost to the World Food Program, run by HUNTER BIDEN!  The prize committee gave trump the biggest fuck you possible - and it happened on an international stage.  And I love them for it.  It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve laughed this hard."}
