The President is, well, the President of the United States. He doesn't have Blue Cross, Humana, Medicaid, Medicare. He has \"I'm the leader of the U.S.A and I will get treatment the average person cannot.\" He cannot compare his experience to any other american. I am a paraplegic who has chronic UTI's. Something that is not awesome but not something I think will just take me out like Covid-19. When I enter the hospital, I am on a timer. My insurance is looking for any reason to get me out the door. This is not the case with Trump. He could have lived at the Hospital if he desired. When he says he now gets Covid, There is no way that he does. He is treated better than ANYONE, even self pay patients. He received treatments that I believe only 11 other people have. Please let your friends and family know that you will not get the same experience, and that's if they even keep you at the hospital. In several cases they just street you and say \"quarantine yourself.\""}
