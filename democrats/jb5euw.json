Over the past four years I've watched my dad transform from a life long democrat into a die hard Trump supporter, and trap himself in a Fox News echo chamber. Our arguments are typically non-substantive, revolve around Trump's character, and end in shouting matches. With 20 days left till the election I'm hoping to change my approach and make one last effort to change his mind. Rather than making another emotional plea, I want to be able to show my dad trumps biggest failures, in non disputable terms, all organized in one place. Does such a list exist?"}
