I\u2019m from the Deep South and most of my relatives are currently steeped in the Trump narrative, bending it against all conceivable probability to fit a radical evangelical viewpoint. The cognitive dissonance is staggering. I would like to gently broach the topic with them, but I want to go prepared. Has anyone in a similar situation had success in reaching across the aisle? \n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in grounding them in the importance of separation of church and state. Would a tables turned scenario be best? As in imagining with them that a non-Christian religion predominated and they lived in fear of that religion taking over the government and creating laws against their way of life?\n\nTIA, on the front lines down here :/"}
