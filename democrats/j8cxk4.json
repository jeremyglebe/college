Kamala Harris is in favor of full legalization and has a voting record to prove it. If I have my facts wrong there PLEASE correct me.\n\nNow, the speculation part. Let\u2019s put it in a few questions:\n1. How likely overall is it that federal marijuana legalization happens under a Biden-Harris admin?\n2. If it is likely to happen, is there a realistic chance for any sort of federal ruling on prisoners serving time on weed possession charges (NOT intent to distribute which I understand is a different issue)? (I also understand this is partly a state issue where fed gov has limited influence but an official \u201cpossession charges are dismissed\u201d opinion from fed could influence state policy)\n3. If you don\u2019t think fed legalization is likely under Biden-Harris, how many more state legalizations would be necessary before they took action?\n\nTo be perfectly clear I have already voted Biden, there is no need to convince me. Just generally curious what ppl think of what might happen with weed federally under Biden-Harris. Thanks in advance for any responses"}
