I was met with a message on fresnogop.org: \"It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try a search?\". I noticed that the navigation bars in the header & footer did not contain anything related to ballot collection information, but I started exploring their site. I noticed that much of their site had been scrubbed of any reference to their participation in the illegal ballot collection, but they missed some of the references to \"Ballot Collection Box Locations\" in some parts of their website:\n\n- from https://www.fresnogop.org/, the header/footer link to section \"Ballot Collection Box Locations\"\n\n   - Appears on:\n\n     - About Us (about)\n     - Election Transparency Lost (current-issues)\n     - Endorsements & Propositions (prop-13)\n\n - DOES NOT Appear on:\n\n     - Home\n     - Ballot Collection Box Locations (ballot-collection-box-locations)\n     - Events (events)\n     - Electeds (connect-elected-officials)\n     - POTUS (president-trump)\n     - CAGOP (cagop)\n     - Donate (donate)\n     - Volunteer (volunteer)\n\n[* Washington Post Article Excerpt: \"But Republican leaders are encouraging voters to bring their completed ballots to unlisted sites equipped with the unofficial green boxes, at locations including smog checks and gas stations.\"; \"sites\" was linked to \"https://www.fresnogop.org/ballot-collection-box-locations/\"]\n\n\nEDIT: I meant to include this, but forgot, until now...
