The Secretary of State has guesstimated about 2 million Georgians will vote during Early Voting as opposed to about 1 million expected on Election Day.  It's critical that I have an opportunity to share my message.\n\nI've been interviewed by [Indivisible GA-11](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGDus10k3ldo23KwqgVAjEg/playlists), I've been on [PeachPod: A Georgia Politics Podcast](https://medium.com/peachpod/william-hughes-is-running-for-state-house-in-cherokee-county-ef25214ff922), spoken on [Polititeen](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yNDgwZDlhNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/NmYyZDRiZTctZjhkNy00ZjY3LTlhN2EtMTIyOTQzNmMxYTI3?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWndXkjJzsAhV_azABHXfZBfUQkfYCegQIARAF), as well as [The Kids Wear Crowns - Don't Call This A Podcast](https://thekidswearcrowns.com/2020/09/11/pt-18-release-the-tapes-ft-shelly-hutchinson-william-hughes-election2020-mini-series/).\n\nAlways looking for more opportunities!\n\n[Hughes For Georgia Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hughes4GA)"}
