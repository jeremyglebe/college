If you look more into the history of the life Hunter Biden has lived, he was in a car crash where he lost his mother and younger sister, and suffered a childhood brain injury. He then lost his only remaining sibling from Joe\u2019s first marriage to brain cancer when Beau Biden passed in 2015. He has had anything but an easy life, and as someone who personally has had some struggles with substance use I found this to be disgraceful. How can we ever get past the mental health stigma when our president thinks someone\u2019s child\u2019s addiction is a means to discredit them in an argument? Especially when it\u2019s so obvious as to why Hunter happened to turn to drug use? I knew trump was a disgrace, but this is a new low."}
