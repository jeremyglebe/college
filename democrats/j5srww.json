That\u2019s the better part of 4 years...he has \u201ccreated\u201d 6.6 million jobs. Furthermore,you don\u2019t get to include the jobs you lost due to your mismanagement of the Covid-19 virus.\n\nI really hate living in Pennsylvania when there\u2019s a Presidential Election...every one of Trump\u2019s campaign ads looks like the bottom feeding SuperPAC ads you see...who are loose on facts and heavy on rhetoric.\n\nOh yeah...one more thing? In the very beginning of the ad that, it said....\u201dDonald Trump DID THE IMPOSSIBLE in his first four years....WTF is he talking about? Dividing the country? Adding yet another handout to billionaires? What did he do that was so....IMPOSSIBLE?"}
