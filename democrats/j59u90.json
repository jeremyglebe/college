A goal that would cause millions of preventable deaths. \n\nTrump will surely use his relatively mild case (caught early through testing nobody has access to with treatments nobody else has access to) to argue the disease is no big deal and we should open up more. Get rid of these mask mandates. \n\nHe may even promote his own supposed \u2018immunity\u2019 as a reason to get it!!  \n\nSo the 2020 election is now LITERALLY Biden vs COVID."}
