"""Creates an adjacency matrix from an input file of edges.

Course: 5243 Algorithm Analysis
Due: 4/26/2020
Receives an input file containing a list of edges between vertices. Parses the
input to determine what unique vertices are present in the graph and what edges
exist in the graph. Then constructs the graph in the form of Adjacency Matrix.

Algorithm:
    1) Read contents of file into a string
    2) Create set of unique vertices
    3) Sort the set of vertices
    4) Assign corresponding indices to each vertex (keep a map for lookup)
        * Even numeric vertices should be assigned a corresponding index as a
          graph containing vertices 1, 5, and 99 should still be
          indexed 0-2 instead of 0-99, for efficiency's sake
    5) Determine number of vertices
    6) Create a 2D array representing edges between vertices
        * Initialize the array with 'False' in each slot
    7) For each line of input, for vertices U and V, assign Matrix[U][V] to
       True and Matrix[V][U] to true.
    8) Output the adjacency matrix
        * Output to file in append mode for multiple outputs in one file
